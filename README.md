This repository is used to get size conversions for HTML Elements.

Imagine you know the size of an HTML Element that is currently being shown in a 1920 x 1080 screen, and, for some reason, you need it to be shown on a 1280 x 720 screen, but you can't use relative measures.

This API makes it easy to make this calculations.

You can try the API in RapidAPI.
